    <h1>Word Counter</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">I remembered you was conflicted
        Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
        Abusing my power full of resentment
        Resentment that turned into a deep depression
        Found myself screaming in the hotel room
        I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
        So I went runnin' for answers.</p>
